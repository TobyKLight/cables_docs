### Will I have to pay for it in the future?

All the major features of cables will always be free for use by everyone. There are no plans on restricting use to
any current or future new ops or features to something like "pro" or "premium" users.

If things get too big we might charge for additional storage space for your assets or something. Rest assured
that the free version of cables.gl will be abolutely usable at all times.


### Is there a way to support cables development somehow?

First of all: spread the word. Use it! Give feedback! Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cablesgl) and [Github Discussions](https://github.com/cables-gl/cables_docs/discussions)!
