# How to contribute code to cables

So you found something missing in cables, integrated a new technology or fixed a bug? Awesome!

The easiest way to contribute this to the community is to [create a team](https://cables.gl/myteams) and then:

- clone or rename your ops to the [team namespace](../../../5_1_permissions/3_ops/ops)
- [make the team public](../../../5_1_permissions/2_teams/teams), so people can join and use your ops
- promote your ops, have people join your team, collect feedback, gather collaborators
- for bugfixes or improvements in core ops: contact us on [discord](https://discord.gg/cablesgl)

Thanks for contributing!
