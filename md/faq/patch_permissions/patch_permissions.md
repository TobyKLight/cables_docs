# Patch Permissions

A cables patch can have different states and also different people working on the project. Here is a rundown of the
different levels of permission cables offers to teams and individuals.

## Public

You can, and should, make a patch public to show it to the world and the cables community. Every person with the
URL to your patch can look at it on the patch page, open the editor to see how you patched it all together and
clone it to remix the patch. If you come across a public patch and want to remix it, we strongly encourage you
to adhere to the licence the patch has been published with. Credit the author(s)!

While it is possible to view a patch with [user-ops](../../5_writing_ops/coding_ops) on the patch page and the editor, cloning such a patch will
need the patch owner to be a collaborator (see below) in the patch for their user-ops to work.

## Secret Link

If you want to be a bit more restrictive on who to send your patch to, you can create a secret link. From the
patch settings, create a secret link and send it to the person you want to have a look at the patch (convenient for
sending previews to clients, for example).

Any person with a secret link can view the patch on the patch page, but not open it in the editor. Access to
the patch can be requested though, it is then up to you to decide the level of access you want to grant (see below).

## Team Patch

If you work in a larger group of people, or have a project that spans multiple patches, you can easily group them
together by creating a [team](/teams). Any patch associated with the team will allow the team members to see it on the patch
page and in the editor.

Team members will also be able to request access (in that case "Full Access" (see below)) to a patch. It is up
to the owner of the patch to grant access to patches. You, as the owner, will find new request for access on the
[activity feed](/myactivityfeed) after clicking on the red bubble notification on your welcome page.

## Read-Only

When inviting people to your patch, or on replying to any request for access to a patch, the owner can decide on
the level of access to grant to a user.

"Read Only" means that the person will be added as a collaborator to the patch, can view the patch on the patch
page and open the editor. They will also be able to clone your project and remix it.

## Full Access

People with full access to a patch will be able to both view the patch and edit it. They are also able to decide on
the permission levels of other collaborators and invite new ones, as well as edit patch settings.

## Owner

On top of all the other permissions that full access grants to collaborators, the owner can make other people owner
of the patch. The owner is the person to be shown in all the [overviews for patches](/patches) on cables.gl and can configure some options
for exports that need third-party credentials (i.e. [github-pages](../../4_export_embed/dev_embed/export_netlify/export_netlify) or [netlify](../../4_export_embed/dev_embed/export_github/export_github)).

Also the owner of a patch will be in charge to manage all requests for access.
