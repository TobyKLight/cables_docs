# Export for Cables Standalone Version

Select the "Standalone" option in the export dialog. Download the latest version of ["cables standalone"](https://cables.gl/downloads).

Install and/or open the standalone version, select "Open Patch" from the menu or the welcome screen, select
the `.json` file you just downloaded. Start patching!

Be aware, that there is currently no way to re-import patches that you worked on in "cables standalone"
to cables.gl. This will be in one of the next releases!

Have a look at [our roadmap](https://github.com/cables-gl/cables_electron/milestones?direction=desc&sort=due_date&state=open) for future versions and [report bugs](https://github.com/cables-gl/cables_electron/issues) or submit [feature requests](https://github.com/cables-gl/cables_electron/issues). Any feedback is greatly appreciated!
